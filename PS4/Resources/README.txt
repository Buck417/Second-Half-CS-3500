This is an empty project that contains the resources for a Spreadsheet.

The Spreadsheet has an infinite number of cells, which can contain strings, numbers, or formulas. 
Cells can have names, contents, and values. A cell's contents differs from its values in that with 
formulas, a cell's value is the result of the formula's evaluation.



UPDATE: Saturday October 10th, 2015

As part of the PS5 implementation of this spreadsheet, we had to get the cell's value. I chose to recursively 
lookup the variable's value until there was a variable that returned a double.

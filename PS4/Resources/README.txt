This is an empty project that contains the resources for a Spreadsheet.

The Spreadsheet has an infinite number of cells, which can contain strings, numbers, or formulas. 
Cells can have names, contents, and values. A cell's contents differs from its values in that with 
formulas, a cell's value is the result of the formula's evaluation.

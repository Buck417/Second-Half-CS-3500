Needed Work:
Worked on generating food cubes. Need to make sure to update the parameters for the cubes(Team_id and Uid)

Added a width to the world. Need to read from xml file to get the correct width for the world.

In Receive_Player_Name, correctly coverted the json player name from client to player. Need to take that player name and create a proper cube in the world. We
currently dont have a way of inputting correct values into the parameters. I did add a global variable for player mass. These values must then be sent correctly.

Need to randomly generate team and player id's and keep track of those while the game is played. List?

Need to make adding food cubes random. We dont want cubes being added as soon as one is eaten. But still want cubes added. So from 1-5 seconds.

Need to keep placement of food cubes somewhat organized. Some clumping is good but dont want 90% in top left corner. Some uniform distribution.


Things We Should Skip For Now:
Heartbeats
Handling multiple clients
Handling splitting(will involve dictionaries and timing)


Notes About How The Game Should Be Played:
Overlapping should be allowed for food cubes, wont have to worry about where they are randomly placed
